Behavioral Analysis 

Overview
This is a Streamlit web application designed for behavioral analysis using machine learning techniques. The application preprocesses the data, conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA), and trains a machine learning model to predict behavioral patterns based on input features.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the dataset, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and segmenting categorical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides visualizations and insights into the dataset to understand the relationships between different variables.
Machine Learning Model: Trains a Decision Tree classifier to predict behavioral patterns based on input features.
Interactive Web Interface: Utilizes Streamlit to create an interactive and user-friendly interface for data exploration and model evaluation.
